@daughter_of_polonius: You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
@down_with_claudius: Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
@daughter_of_polonius: Will he tell us what this show meant?
@down_with_claudius: We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.
@daughter_of_polonius: Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
@down_with_claudius: Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
@daughter_of_polonius: What means this, my lord?
@down_with_claudius: Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches, then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot.'
@down_with_claudius: So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet?
@daughter_of_polonius: Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
@down_with_claudius: O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
@daughter_of_polonius: Ay, my lord.
@down_with_claudius: Who, I?
@daughter_of_polonius: You are merry, my lord.
@down_with_claudius: Nothing.
@daughter_of_polonius: What is, my lord?
@down_with_claudius: That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
@daughter_of_polonius: I think nothing, my lord.
@down_with_claudius: Do you think I meant country matters?
@daughter_of_polonius: Ay, my lord.
@down_with_claudius: I mean, my head upon your lap?
@daughter_of_polonius: No, my lord.
@down_with_claudius: Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
@daughter_of_polonius: O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword; The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
@down_with_claudius: To a nunnery, go.
@down_with_claudius: I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are.
@daughter_of_polonius: O heavenly powers, restore him!
@down_with_claudius: To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.
@down_with_claudius: If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.
@daughter_of_polonius: O, help him, you sweet heavens!
@down_with_claudius: Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
@daughter_of_polonius: At home, my lord.
@down_with_claudius: Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?
@daughter_of_polonius: I was the more deceived.
@down_with_claudius: You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.
@daughter_of_polonius: Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
@down_with_claudius: this was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
@down_with_claudius: Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness:
@daughter_of_polonius: Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
@down_with_claudius: That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
@daughter_of_polonius: What means your lordship?
@down_with_claudius: Are you fair?
@daughter_of_polonius: My lord?
@down_with_claudius: Ha! ha! are you honest?
@daughter_of_polonius: My honour'd lord, you know right well you did; And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed As made the things more rich: their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord.
@down_with_claudius: I never gave you aught.
@down_with_claudius: No, not I;
@daughter_of_polonius: My lord, I have remembrances of yours, That I have longed long to re-deliver; I pray you, now receive them.
@down_with_claudius: I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
@daughter_of_polonius: Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?
@down_with_claudius: The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember'd.
@down_with_claudius: And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
@down_with_claudius: Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
@down_with_claudius: The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of?
@down_with_claudius: For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
@down_with_claudius: Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
@down_with_claudius: The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
@down_with_claudius: And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end
@down_with_claudius: The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
@down_with_claudius: To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
